A collection of mini React projects solving various [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) challenges. This repository serves as a simple practice project to learn and sharpen React skills by tackling small coding tasks.

## Overview

This repository contains multiple standalone mini-projects, each dedicated to solving a particular HackerRank coding challenge. All projects were built using basic React principles and aim for clarity and simplicity.

## Project Structure

Each folder in the root directory corresponds to a specific challenge or mini-project:

- **article-sorting** – A simple application for sorting articles based on different criteria
- **blog-post** – Demonstrates how to structure and render a single blog post
